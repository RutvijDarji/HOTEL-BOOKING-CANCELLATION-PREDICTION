# HOTEL-BOOKING-CANCELLATION-PREDICTION (Predictive Analytics)
This project examines data sets related to hotel cancellations to uncover patterns and insights that influence decision making in the hotel industry. Our analysis includes research into factors that influence booking cancellations, including booking time, booking channel and room type. Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, we identify the most important predictors of cancellation and develop models to predict potential cancellation. 
# Dataset Information 
This data article describes two data sets that contain hotel demand data. One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets have the same structure, with 31 variables explaining 40,060 observations in H1 and 79,330 observations in H2. Each check represents a hotel reservation. Both datasets include orders placed between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017, including orders that were actually placed and canceled. Cancellations are a common challenge for hotels as they impact revenue streams and require a strategic approach to cost reduction. In this context, datasets serve as a valuable repository of information, including booking data, customer demographics and booking channels.
# Data Mining Goals
In this project, cancellation prediction is the specific data mining goals for business understanding in the context of hotel reservation data which predicts the likelihood of a reservation being canceled or allowing hotels to manage overbooking and improve resource allocation.
